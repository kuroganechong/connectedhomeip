trying out example at /examples/lighting-app/esp32

To prepare the environment, need to start idf.py terminal by running `source export.sh` in {esp-idf installation}/esp-idf_tools/esp-idf/
Then run `source {connectedhomeip installation}/scripts/activate.sh`
Then run `export IDF_CCACHE_ENABLE=1` to accelerate build

In the project folder, can do common idf settings and operations:
idf.py set-target esp32
idf.py menuconfig
    - in Demo set device type
    - in Component config > CHIP Device Layer set VendorID, ProductID
    - and other related settings such as LED GPIO etc
    - S to save, Q to quit
idf.py build
idf.py flash
